# Chess Woodpecker

## Overview
Chess Woodpecker is a mobile application designed to help chess players improve their pattern recognition and calculation skills through systematic puzzle training. The application implements the "Woodpecker Method," a training technique where players solve the same set of puzzles repeatedly to build pattern recognition and improve their tactical vision.

## Core Concept
The Woodpecker Method involves:
1. Solving a fixed set of puzzles multiple times
2. Tracking progress and improvement over time
3. Building pattern recognition through repetition
4. Focusing on quality over quantity of puzzles

## Key Features

### Puzzle Collection
- Exactly 200 carefully selected chess puzzles
- Evenly distributed across 10 tactical themes (20 puzzles per theme)
- Each puzzle is designed to teach specific tactical patterns
- Puzzles are served in a controlled, non-repeating sequence during sessions

### Training Session
- Users are presented with one puzzle at a time
- Puzzles are served randomly but never repeated within a session
- Each session contains exactly 200 unique puzzles
- After each puzzle attempt (success or failure):
  - The solution is shown
  - A new random puzzle is served
  - Progress is tracked

### Learning Process
1. Initial exposure to puzzles builds basic pattern recognition
2. Repeated solving of the same set reinforces patterns
3. Tracking progress helps identify improvement areas
4. Focus on specific themes helps develop targeted tactical skills

## Technical Implementation
The application is built using:
- Flutter/Dart for cross-platform mobile development
- PostgreSQL database for puzzle storage
- RESTful API backend for puzzle serving
- Modern mobile UI/UX principles

## Target Users
- Chess players of all levels
- Players looking to improve tactical vision
- Those interested in systematic training methods
- Users who prefer focused, quality practice over quantity

## Expected Outcomes
Users who consistently practice with Chess Woodpecker should see:
- Improved pattern recognition
- Faster tactical calculation
- Better tactical vision
- More consistent tactical play
- Measurable progress through repeated solving
